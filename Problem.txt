Given n(0≤n≤100,000) rectangles, each defined by their top-left and bottom-right corners represented by coordinates (x, y) where 0.0≤x,y≤1,000,000.0. For example, the coordinates '10 50 90 120' denote a rectangle with the top-left corner at (10, 50) and the bottom-right corner at (90, 120). There will be no intersections between the edges of these rectangles. Some rectangles may be contained within others, and they may be stacked on top of each other. The task is to find the count of the most nested rectangle.

File name: `rec.inp`
Input: The first line indicates the number of rectangles, followed by n lines containing the coordinates of the top-left and bottom-right corners of each rectangle.

File name: `nested.out`
Output: A single number representing the count of the most nested rectangles.
